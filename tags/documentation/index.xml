      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I spoke about the secret sauce behind successful APIs - documentation. This talk covered:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Problem areas with API projects from experience,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An API&amp;rsquo;s journey from a producer as well as the consumer perspectives, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How to use documentation along each step of the API lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Write the Docs Australia - Community management</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.writethedocs.org/&#34;&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/a&gt; is a global community of people who care about documentation. We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;contribution&#34;&gt;Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While we have had other communities in Australia that covered technical documentation sporadically, there was no community for like- minded people to get together and talk about documentation issues. I have been part of other groups that organised technical writing events and conferences in the past, but in 2016, none of these groups existed and there was a serious gap in community events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Madworld 2018: What&#39;s the deal with Release notes?</title>
      <link>https://swapnilogale.github.io/publications/releasenotes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Product managers swear by them, development managers are keen on producing them and quite so often your developers or engineers will help (grudgingly) craft them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Release notes are everywhere, be it a product or a process. They are quite often your first point of communication with customers eager to know whatâ€™s new or fixed in your product or process. In some instances, they also become the most frequently or commonly accessed content on your documentation site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Write the Docs Prague 2016: When bad screenshots happen to good writers</title>
      <link>https://swapnilogale.github.io/publications/screenshots/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have your content moving at a swift pace, your documents are getting reviewed in a timely fashion (surprise!) and you are nicely heading towards your release milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only thing missing are some key screenshots that you need to put in before you publish your documentation. What you get instead are some hideous images posing as screenshots, that were captured randomly, bears no resemblance to your instructions and would make no sense whatsoever to the end user.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Art of the Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.knowledgeowl.com/&#34;&gt;KnowledgeOwl&lt;/a&gt; to write a guest post for their blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote about why proper reviews are vital to the documentation process, how to plan for them, various kinds of reviews, and how to provide to feedback (if you are the one reviewing someone else&amp;rsquo;s docs!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
