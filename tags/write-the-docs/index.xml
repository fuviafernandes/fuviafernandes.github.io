      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.writethedocs.org/&#34;&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/a&gt; is a global community of people who care about documentation. We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;contribution&#34;&gt;Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While we have had other communities in Australia that covered technical documentation sporadically, there was no community for like- minded people to get together and talk about documentation issues. I have been part of other groups that organised technical writing events and conferences in the past, but in 2016, none of these groups existed and there was a serious gap in community events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
